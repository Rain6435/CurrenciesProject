This project is an in depth implementation of the genetic algorithm. The context is a population of currencies imported through an API and submitted to different methods that return specific values and finally, a new population that has been through crossover and mutation. All populations can be and are subjected to a fitness function which separates the populations by a positive or null conversion yield. A population that has a positive yield is then stored and written in a CSV file.
